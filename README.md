# ToDoList
For the ToDoList, I practice using Javascript to make an interactive ToDo list.

- **Hover** Over an item on list to reveal the delete button

- **Click** on an item to cross it out or uncross it
![alt text](img/cross.png)
- Type anything inside the **Add New Todo** to add to the list then press **enter** 
![alt text](img/textIn.png)
- Select **plus** logo to hide text box
```
