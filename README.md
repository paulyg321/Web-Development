# ToDoList
For the ToDoList, I practice using Javascript to make an interactive ToDo list. 
- **Hover** Over an item on list to reveal the delete button
- **Click** on an item to cross it out or uncross it
- **Click** plus logo to hide text box
- Type anything inside the **Add New Todo** to add to the list then press **enter** 

# PatClone
This is a Patatap clone. You press a key and using the paperjs library, a circle pops up on the screen and slowly fades away
